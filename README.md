```

### üßê Reading Exif
```ts
// ...
const uri = 'file://path/to/image.jpg'

const tags = await readAsync(uri)
console.log(tags)
```

### ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Exif
```ts
const uri = 'file://path/to/image.jpg'
const newTags: ExifTags = {
  GPSLatitude: 69.696969,
  GPSLongitude: 69.696969,
  UserComment: 'Someone wrote GPS here!',
}

const result = await writeAsync(uri, newTags)
console.log(result)

üí° Note: On IOS, writing exif into an Asset file will duplicate the image.
Try to write to a local file first before saving!
