# React Native Exify

A simple library to read and write image Exif metadata in React Native. Inspired from [this thread](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-vision-camera/issues/780).

## Features
- Read Exif data from an image
- Write Exif data into an image
- Tags are typed and standardized
- Works with Expo and bare React Native projects

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @lodev09/react-native-exify
```

## Usage

```ts
import { writeAsync, readAsync, ExifTags } from '@lodev09/react-native-exify';
```

### üßê Reading Exif
```ts
// ...
const uri = 'file://path/to/image.jpg'

const tags = await readAsync(uri)
console.log(tags)
```

### ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Exif
```ts
const uri = 'file://path/to/image.jpg'
const newTags: ExifTags = {
  GPSLatitude: 69.69,
  GPSLongitude: 69.69,
  UserComment: 'Someone wrote GPS here!',
}

const result = await writeAsync(uri, newTags)
console.log(result.tags)
```

See [example](example) for more detailed usage.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Note that on IOS, writing exif into an Asset file will duplicate the image. IOS does not allow writing exif into an Asset file directly.

If you're getting the photo from a [camera](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-vision-camera/), write it into the output file first before saving to the Asset library!
