# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Setup the Application

```bash
yarn setup
```

This will [prebuild](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/prebuild/) the project. Prebuild means it will create the native `ios` and `android` for you to get started.

## Step 2: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

### ‚öõÔ∏è TS

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

### üçé IOS

Open `ios/ExifyExample.xcworkspace` in Xcode and run the project. Browse to _Pods -> Development -> Exify_ folder. Modify to your heart's content. You will need to rebuild the project to see your changes.

### ü§ñ Android

Open `android` in Android Studio and run the project. Browse to _android -> app -> src -> ... -> MainActivty.kt_. Modify to your heart's content. You will need to rebuild the project to see your changes.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
